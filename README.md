# FitLit!

## Overview of Project 
### Description
Fitlit was a group project assigned to a group of three students in Mod 2 of Turing's front-end engineering bootcamp. Students were given a week to present a useful dashboard for a user to view and see their latest activity data, goals, and milestones using data from three different APIs. The details of this project are outline in [this project spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html).

### Goals
- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed.
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
- Create a dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.
- Make network requests to retrieve data.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
- Fetch API
- Webpack
- Chart.js
- Mocha/Chai
- GitHub project board

## Installation Instructions:
- Clone the repository to your local machine. 
- Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory. 
- Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to get local host URL. 
- Copy local host and paste it in your browswer to view the website.
- To quit out of npm start click control C in your terminal.

## Reflection

### Wins
- This was our first time making a network request to retrieve data from an API, so being able to use that data in our code base was an exciting win.
- This was also our first time using Chart.js. We manipulated the data we fetched and then used it to create our charts, so we are proud of our ability to learn two new technologies and use them together in our project.

### Challenges 
- Initially, we struggled to write DRY code. We refactored to make our code more reusable, but this was not as efficient as writing DRY code from the beginning. 
- We could have improved our project board by using issue labels.

### Future Considerations
- As of now, there is no user interaction on our app. 
- In the future, we would like to enable the user to choose which week's data is displayed on their chart.
- We would like to create some sort of step challenge users can participate in with their friends.
- We would like to add a login page for a user.
- We also would like to use the WAVE evaluation tool to evaluate web accessibility.
